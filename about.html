                    <p>This game has been carefully designed with the fundamental purpose of generating a deeper
                        understanding of the challenges faced by those struggling with mental health issues. Through a
                        combination of narrative and metaphorical games, it seeks to educate, raise awareness, and
                        provide practical strategies to confront these challenges. <br><br>

                        Each challenge in the game symbolizes a common internal struggle experienced by individuals
                        facing mental health problems. From representing anxiety as an obstacle to be overcome to
                        depicting mazes symbolizing mental confusion, every element of the game is designed to reflect
                        and symbolize the emotional complexities involved in this battle.<br><br>

                        The purpose of "Mente en Equilibrio" is not only to provide entertainment but also to create a
                        safe space where players can explore and better understand the realities of mental health. By
                        playing this game, participants will have the opportunity to gain a more empathetic and
                        understanding perspective towards those grappling with these challenges in their daily lives.
